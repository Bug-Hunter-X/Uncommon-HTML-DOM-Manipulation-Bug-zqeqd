# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to DOM manipulation in HTML. The bug involves hiding a div element and attempting to re-append it to the DOM after a delay. The re-appending logic contains a flaw that can lead to unexpected behavior and potential errors.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML code hides a div element using JavaScript. After a delay, the code attempts to re-append this div element back to the document body. However, the implementation incorrectly attempts to re-append the element, which may cause the element not to be redisplayed or unexpected behavior because it is already a child of the document body.  The solution fixes this by checking if the element is already in the DOM before attempting the append operation.

## How to Reproduce
1. Open `bug.html` in your browser.
2. Click the "Click Me" button.
3. Observe that the div element disappears.
4. After 3 seconds, the div element may or may not reappear, depending on the browser and the implementation of this particular bug. 
5. Examine `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected version.
